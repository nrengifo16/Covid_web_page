# Covid_web_page_systems_dynamics
Web platform for data collection, visualization, analysis, prediction and evaluation of control strategies for the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 through mathematical modeling,
 simulation and artificial intelligence tools.
In the system dynamics module, we worked on a differential equations model based on the cause effect relation between the variables. We explore the complex relationships and
 feedback cycles that exist between the spread of the COVID-19 virus, saturation of the health system, and some social-economic variables such as employment and production.
The uploaded model was developed in Stella Architect software.
