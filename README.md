In this research, forecasting module, we propose a mathematical model based on q-exponential family of functions. As will be presented in the results section, we obtained a great performance when predicting variableswith exponential or logistic behaviour, such as confirmed deaths by COVID-19 in different countries.Depending of the behaviour, rolling windows methodology is employed. In a similar way, q-exponentialparameters are estimated minimizing the prediction error.

In the system dynamics module, we worked on a differential equations model based on the cause effect relation between the variables. We explore the complex relationships and
 feedback cycles that exist between the spread of the COVID-19 virus, saturation of the health system, and some social-economic variables such as employment and production.
